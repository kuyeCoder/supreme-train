      <pre>
This sound is going round the world
Angels of favour are going to be released
As these sound are listened to, all around the globe
Favour, favour, favour like a shield
</pre
      >
      <pre>
Favour! It surrounds me like a shield
It will cover me from now
Until the day I see my King
Lift your voice and shout "favour"
Favour! It surrounds me like a shield
It will cover me from now
Until the day I see my King
Shout it louder, favour!
Favour! It surrounds me like a shield
It will cover me from now
Until the day I see my King
</pre
      >
      <pre>
The next one
Power, it's erupting from within
It is moving me from now
Until the day I see my king
Power, it's erupting from within
It is moving me from now
Until the day I see my king
One more time, power!
Power, it's erupting from within
It is moving me from now
Until the day I see my king
</pre
      >
      <pre>
Fire
Fire
Fire
Fire
Fire, it is burning in my soul
It is driving me from now
Until the day I see my king
Shout fire!
Fire, it is burning in my soul
It is driving me from now
Until the day I see my king
One more time, fire!
Fire, it is burning in my soul
It is driving me from now
Until the day I see my king
</pre
      >
      <pre>
Mercy oh!
Mercy, it has washed away my sin
And it is opening doors for me
Until the day I see my king
Mercy oh!
Mercy, it has washed away my sin
And it is opening doors for me
Until the day I see my king
</pre
      >
      <pre>
Favour! It surrounds me like a shield
It will cover me from now
Until the day I see my King
Favour! It surrounds me like a shield
It will cover me from now
Until the day I see my King
One more time
Favour! It surrounds me like a shield
It will cover me from now
Until the day I see my King
One last time, say!
Favour! It surrounds me like a shield
It will cover me from now
Until the day I see my King
